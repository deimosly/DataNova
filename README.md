## Overview

**DataNova** is a research-driven Python project for analyzing and classifying stellar data using correlation heatmaps and HR (Hertzsprung–Russell) diagram visualization.  
It automates exploratory data analysis, detects strong feature correlations, and produces scientifically styled visualizations aligned with professional astrophysical research practices.

This repository accompanies the paper:  
> *Locmelis-Lunovs, E. (2025). DataNova: A Correlation-Based Approach to Stellar Classification.*

## Features

- Automated correlation heatmap generation across all numerical features  
- HR diagram plotting with luminosity–temperature mapping  
- Outlier detection and data normalization  
- High-quality plots for academic publishing (vectorized, color-balanced)  
- Detailed research log (`research_log.txt`) documenting runtime activity

## Installation

Clone the repository and install required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/DataNova.git
